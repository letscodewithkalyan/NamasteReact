- React is fast not only with React but with bundle tools coming along with it.
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is a zero-configuration build tool (bundler) that helps optimize React apps by improving build speed, reducing bundle size, and enhancing performance. Hereâ€™s how it makes React fast:

# Parcel

- DEV Build
- Local Server
- HMR - Hot Module Replacement (Hot reload in mobile) (Parcel uses file wacther algarotham which is written in c++ for this)
- Caching - For faster builds
- Image optimization
- Minification
- Bundling
- Compress
- Consistent hashing
- Code spliting
- Differential Bundling - support older browsers
- Diagnostic
- Error Handling
- HTTPS
- [ParcelJs](https://parceljs.org/)

- Native performance
- Multi-core
- Reliable caching
- Lazy Dev Builds
- Tree Shaking

## for building with parcel

- npx parcel index.html (DEV)
- npx parcel build index.html (Prod)
